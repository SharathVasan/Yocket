Scenario:
Consider a scenario where you are a big spiderman fan and the latest spiderman movie has been released. You absolutely want to avoid spoilers on youtube, 
yet also browse through daily video content. You decide to make a basic script that blocks all spoiler videos. 
What should be the logic/solution to implement in this scenario? 
You can explain the answer in a textual format in points.

Solution and thoughts:
1. Keywords in the key here. I would write my script in such a way that it would hide all the content including videos, comments and channels
  that would match the keyword. Unforturnately I don't know how to implement this, I don't know even if it's possible unless you work on the serverside.
  
2. Youtube has an option in it's community settings to block the comments with the keywords which you wish for. You can enter unlimited keywords considering all 
  the content that would relate to the spoiler.
  
3. Apart from these there are multiple chrome extensions and third party tools which will block the spoiler videos and give you spoiler free browsing experience.
